# Space Defender Project

First python project

Game Elements: The game consists of a player character, enemies (both normal and strong), bullets, power-ups, and health items.

Player Control: The player can move left and right using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar.

Enemy Behavior: Normal enemies move downward from random positions at the top of the screen, while strong enemies occasionally appear and move downward. The number and speed of enemies increase as the player's score rises.

Collision Detection: The game detects collisions between bullets and enemies, as well as between the player and enemies. Health items can restore the player's health upon collision.

Scoring System: The player earns points by shooting down enemies. The score increases gradually as the player progresses.

Game Over: The game ends when the player's health reaches zero. A game over screen is displayed, showing the player's final score and providing options to restart or exit the game.

Menu: The game starts with a menu screen where the player can start the game or exit. Background music plays on the menu screen.
